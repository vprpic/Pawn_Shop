# Medieval Pawn Shop
The goal of this game is practicing working with the SQL syntax. The player owns a small shop with a database for his inventory list. In order to procure items for his customers the player needs to input the correct SELECT statement. After the player's inventory gets low on stock he is prompted with a window to shop for new items.
There are two types of customers, one that comes searching for an item, and one that comes with a question.
